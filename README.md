# ECEEMDAN
Enhanced Complete Ensamble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptative Noise


This is an ehancement of the CEEMDAN algorithm to decompose non-stationary and non-linear signals onto intrisinc modes functions. The paper with the explanation of the functioning of this algorithm can be found in:
